## Review
Congratulations on building your first flow! 

Let's do a quick review of what you've learned so far:

- You created a simple flow that saves email attachments to your Microsoft OneDrive for Business account.
- You created a more complicated flow that uses a Microsoft SharePoint list where company employees can suggest tweets. When a tweet is approved, it's automatically posted to the company's Twitter account.
- You learned that there are many templates to help you create even more flows so that you can easily connect your vital services.

You probably did all this quickly. Outstanding!

The easiest way to advance your skills is to run the samples, play around with the templates, and generate more flows.

### What's next?
Regardless of how much experience you began with, we hope you now have a very clear picture of what flows are and how you can start creating new ones.

We've included some useful resources.
