Congratulations on creating using CDS for Apps, and creating your first entity! 

CDS for Apps lets you securely store and manage data that's used by business applications. Standard and custom entities within CDS for Apps provide a secure and cloud-based storage option for your data.

Let's review what you've learned:
- CDS for Apps stores data in entities. 
- If you can, it's preferable to use as many default entities as possible, so that your system is easy to maintain.
- Creating new entities is easy.
- The best way to get data into an entity is to create a template and upload it.
