Congratulations on creating your first model-driven app! 

Defining and enforcing consistent business processes is a key aspect of model-driven app design. Consistent processes help ensure that your app users can focus on their work, not on remembering to perform a set of manual steps.

Let's review what you've learned:

- Model-driven app design is an approach that focuses on quickly adding components to apps. These components include dashboards, forms, views, and charts. 
- No code is required to build model-driven apps.
- Model-driven design uses a metadata-driven architecture so that designers can customize the app.
- The best way to get started building model-driven apps is to use sample apps and data, and then customize the apps.
